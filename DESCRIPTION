Description: SIEVE - a unified framework for the simultaneous testing of differential expression, variablity and skewness of genes using RNA-Seq data.  This framework adopts a compositional data analysis approach to modelling RNA-Seq count data, uses the CLR transformation to convert them into continuous variables, and uses the skew-normal distribution to model them.
