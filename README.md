### SIEVE: One-stop differential expression, variability, and skewness analyses using RNA-Seq data

Hongxiang Li and Tsung Fei Khang

SIEVE: A statistical method for building a unified framework for the simultaneous testing of differential expression, variance and skewness of genes using RNA-Seq data. This framework adopts a compositional data analysis approach to modelling RNA-Seq count data, applies the centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation to convert them into continuous variables, and uses a skew-normal distribution to model them.
